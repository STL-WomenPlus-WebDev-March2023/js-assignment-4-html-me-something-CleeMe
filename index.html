          This is the first finished mixed media project I ever created. I was
          taking a year long course called LifeBook from Tamara Laporte. The Art
          Angel was one of the individual classes. It has layers of many mediums
          including: paper collage, neocolors, watercolor, acrylic, pencil.
          <br />
          I loved the project when I saw it but wanted an art angel who looked
          more like me so I made mine with a wider face and jaw as well as with
          curls vs. straight hair. The wings gave me all sorts of hassle so in
          the end I just left the latest rendition and told myself to leave them
          be. I still am not a fan of them but I LOVE the curls and the messages
          written into my piece.
