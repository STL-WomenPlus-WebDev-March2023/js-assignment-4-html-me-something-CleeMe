          This is the first finished mixed media project I ever created. I was
          taking a year long course called LifeBook from Tamara Laporte. The Art
          Angel was one of the individual classes. It has layers of many mediums
          including: paper collage, neocolors, watercolor, acrylic, pencil.
          <br />
          I loved the project when I saw it but wanted an art angel who looked
          more like me so I made mine with a wider face and jaw as well as with
          curls vs. straight hair. The wings gave me all sorts of hassle so in
          the end I just left the latest rendition and told myself to leave them
          be. I still am not a fan of them but I LOVE the curls and the messages
          written into my piece.

          We moved from Minnesota to Arizona just 6-8 months before Covid
          happened. When we moved I wasn't sure what path I would take. I was
          considering returning to college, finding a new job, exploring who I
          was or being a Stay At Home Mom. In this time of uncertainty, I
          registered for a drawing class. I am to very thankful I did as I met
          Helen and so many other amazing artists. We were all at different
          stages in our drawing experience so I started on shading a circle and
          adored all the other works of art being created. Each week Helen would
          demo for all of us, walk around with encouragements and hints and lead
          us to find the artist she KNEW was in each of us. When she said we
          would be doing portraits I was certain she meant for everyone else and
          NOT for me. But she helped me find the belief inside me so I could
          start on this piece.
          <br />
          This was done on Bristol Vellum with a Staedtler, Mars Lumograph HB
          pencil and LOTS of kneeded eraser.

         I come from a long line of creators.  They make things - knit, sew, quilt, print (as in on a printing press).  I horde all the 
         handmade items I have been gifted or received through the years.  For my 40th birthday my sister gifted me the 
         experience of learning to quilt with her.  We went and picked out the fabric together.  It is cotton.  Family Lore
         says that she HATED my color choices.  I had no idea.  I thought I did well with my picks.  We went to her house, 
         put West Wing on the tv and started cutting, chaining blocks and finally tying the quilt.  
         The kids, cats, friends and family have all snuggled under my quilt.  This brings me joy!
