          <p id="intro"> I am a creator. 
            I spent most of my life believing that I was a supporter of the makers 
            around me but not a creator in my own right.  I collected tools, watched YouTube
            Videos and every so often I would make something if others were making too.  Then a few 
            years ago I was driving from Minnesota to Arizona alone.  It crossed my mind that if anything
            had happened to me and someone opened the moving truck they would think an artist had left their
            studio behind.  I decided to find classes and explore what I might be interested in.  This process
            was put on hold during COVID so there are classes I didn't get to take and a few years where I just
            didn't have the energy to invest in creation.  Not listed are projects in weaving, crochet, handbuilding clay, 
            wheel throwing clay, and others.

            This is the first finished mixed media project I ever created. I was
            taking a year long course called LifeBook from Tamara Laporte. The
            Art Angel was one of the individual classes. It has layers of many
            mediums including: paper collage, neocolors, watercolor, acrylic,
            pencil.
            <br />
            I loved the project when I saw it but wanted an art angel who looked
            more like me so I made mine with a wider face and jaw as well as
            with curls vs. straight hair. The wings gave me all sorts of hassle
            so in the end I just left the latest rendition and told myself to
            leave them be. I still am not a fan of them but I LOVE the curls and
            the messages written into my piece.

            We moved from Minnesota to Arizona just 6-8 months before Covid
            happened. When we moved I wasn't sure what path I would take. I was
            considering returning to college, finding a new job, exploring who I
            was or being a Stay At Home Mom. In this time of uncertainty, I
            registered for a drawing class. I am to very thankful I did as I met
            Helen and so many other amazing artists. We were all at different
            stages in our drawing experience so I started on shading a circle
            and adored all the other works of art being created. Each week Helen
            would demo for all of us, walk around with encouragements and hints
            and lead us to find the artist she KNEW was in each of us. When she
            said we would be doing portraits I was certain she meant for
            everyone else and NOT for me. But she helped me find the belief
            inside me so I could start on this piece.
            <br />
            This was done on Bristol Vellum with a Staedtler, Mars Lumograph HB
            pencil and LOTS of kneeded eraser.

            I come from a long line of creators. They make things - knit, sew,
            quilt, print (as in on a printing press). I horde all the handmade
            items I have been gifted or received through the years. For my 40th
            birthday my sister gifted me the experience of learning to quilt
            with her. We went and picked out the fabric together. It is cotton.
            Family Lore says that she HATED my color choices. I had no idea. I
            thought I did well with my picks. We went to her house, put West
            Wing on the tv and started cutting, chaining blocks and finally
            tying the quilt. The kids, cats, friends and family have all
            snuggled under my quilt. This brings me joy!

            Earlier this year (2023) I decided to purposefully seek out new
            things to try, learn and do. I found a class to make stackable rings
            so I registered and late on a Saturday night I found myself
            pounding, flaming, sizing and proudly wearing my very own stack of
            silver rings. I returned for the 2nd class in the series and created
            this ring. I have been back a few times and plan to return again
            this summer to make rings with stones my Mother mailed me which she
            said came from my late Grandparents. I look forward to seeing what
            can be done with them and the memories I will carry while I wear the
            rings I create.

            As I was looking for things to do while the kids were at their dads,
            I clicked on an email which I had been ignoring for a few months
            maybe a full year. I am not quite sure why I opened this email on
            this day, but I am so thankful that I did. On a whim I registered
            for the art class happening the next day. It came as a live event
            with a replay available afterwards. Since I hadn't done one of her
            courses before, I decided to experience the live class and actually
            DO the work after while watching the replay. Instead I found myself
            rushing to grab the "ingredients" and play along. This photo is the
            first few layers of line drawings and watercolor paint. I have not
            done a watercolor painting before. I have done color charts and
            played with markings but never attempted a full project. The paint
            went ALL OVER and anywhere it wanted to and was not listening to me
            at all. so I went with it. This is the base, then I will seal it
            with fixative and then add in acrylic and inks and who knows what
            else I find to finish it up.
            <br />
            The point of the art class was to let loose and feel freedom. FROLIC
            - so I did.

            Helen (my friend and teacher from my first Pencil Portrait) is an
            amazing artist well known for her colored pencil works. Covid
            happened so our class was no longer able to meet. I attempted some
            drawing at home during pandemic but found I couldn't focus and just
            didn't have my heart in it. So I put my pencils down. I took
            pictures here and there over the years since then. Thinking I would
            draw them and create from them with the skills I learned from Helen.
            I never did anything until earlier this year when I found a Friday
            class in Kirkwood, MO. You go, pay $10, learn, practice, enjoy the
            work of others and I remember my Helen. Since LaunchCode started I
            haven't returned to the Friday colored pencil class, I just can't
            work it into the schedule so I have been working at home. This will
            take MONTHS - possibly over a year. I am new and colored pencils are
            not a fast medium. They certainly do not have the erratic movement
            of the watercolor paints from the Frolic Filly.
